build character classes as child-classes of PC
-build three initially
--ranger,fighter,mage?
--fuck bards
--once mage is built build out magic
move magic and combat to own folders, out of utility
time for tests
make sure parties(both PC and baddies)work
next up rooms
--two modes(random room, and planned adventure) or just planned?
---start with planned, think about adding random
--sick ascii art?
eventually move from csv's to db tables
